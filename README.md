# FlexFinger

**Robotic Finger with 3 Joints Controlled by Servo Motor**

---

## Overview

FlexFinger is a 3-joint robotic finger that curls by pulling fishing line attached to a servo motor. When the servo pulls, the finger curls; when released, elastic bands bring it back to the starting position. Modeled precisely in Onshape with custom servo mounts and hardware slots for M3 bolts and nuts.

## Features

- Three articulated joints for smooth, human-like finger movement  
- Fishing line tendon-driven actuation for lightweight, responsive control  
- Elastic return mechanism for natural extension  
- Custom servo mount designed for secure, compact fit  
- Mounting holes for standard M3 bolts and nuts for easy assembly

## How It Works

1. Servo motor pulls the fishing line tendon, curling the finger joints.  
2. Releasing the servo lets the elastic bands restore finger to straight position.  
3. Joints designed to avoid binding â€” smooth rotation ensured by precise spacing.

## Assembly

- Attach fishing line tendons securely to each joint segment.  
- Mount servo motor using custom-designed servo mount.  
- Use M3 bolts and nuts to fasten components.  
- Ensure elastic bands are properly tensioned to return finger fully.
